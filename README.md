### Project Description

Role-playing game (RPG) is a very popular gmae genre. The traditional gameplay is "in person", each player has its own character sheet and the game master (GM) usually owns a book. Dices and boards are other important elements of this type of game.

The main goal of this project is to facilitate remote gameplays, where the players and the GM are connected via internet. More than that, it provides features that cannot be possible at an in person environment, and provides a good support for livestreams.

The GM creates a room and adapt character stats and bars to the story. When opened, the players can enter this room and set their characters characteristics. The characters stats are available for everyone, online and in real-time. Character's image can change accordingly with its current health, in real-time too. Dices can be throwed and everyone in the room can see the results.

When gameplay finishes, the GM can close the room, but keeping the data stored for the next gameplay.

### Use Cases

- You want to view your friend's stats while playing.
- You want to show dice results to all players.
- You want to have an immersive experience with dynamic character images, that changes accordingly with its current health.
- You want to livestream your game in an easy and straightforward way.

### How to Host

First of all, it's **highly recommended talking with an IT student or professional** before follow the instructions right after.

This project is designed to be easy to host, but there are unavoidable considerations to take. To host this project you must:

- Download the executable available in the GitHub repository releases. Prefer the LTS version.
- Download a MongoDB database.
- Find a way to provide this server to the internet.

<!-- TODO EXECUTABLE -->

<!-- TODO DATABASE -->

There are many ways to implement the last one, but many of them are not that simple and free. Aside that, **security is a very important thing to care when hosting any application on the internet.**

Using localtunnel is quite simple and free, but it's unstable and it exposes a port of your personal computer to the world. 

Despite that, for many cases localtunnel should be worth to use. Here is a
