### Overview

A role-playing game (RPG) is a very popular game genre. The most traditional way to play it is in person, where each player has its own character sheet and the game master (GM) usually owns the game rules book, and guides the session. Dices and boards are other important elements of this type of game.

The main goal of this project is to facilitate remote RPG sessions, where players and the GM are connected by internet. More than that, it provides features that cannot be possible at a physical environment, and provides a good support for livestreams.

The GM creates a room and adapt character stats and status bars to the story. When opened, the players can enter this room and set their characters' characteristics. The characters' stats are also available for everyone, online and in real-time. A character's image can change accordingly with its current health, in real-time too. Dices can be tossed and everyone in the room can see the results.

When the gameplay finishes, the GM can close the room, but the program keeps the data stored for the next gameplay session.

### Use Cases

- You want to see your friend's stats while playing.
- You want to show dice results to all players.
- You want to have an immersive experience with dynamic character images, that changes accordingly with their current health.
- You want to livestream your game in an easy and straightforward way.

### How to Host

<!--
First things first, it's **highly recommended talking with an IT student or professional** before following the instructions below.

This project is designed to be easy to host, but there are unavoidable considerations to take. To host this project you must:

- Download the executable available in the GitHub repository releases. Opt for the LTS version.
- Download a MongoDB database.
- Find a way to provide this server a internet connection.

<!-- TODO DATABASE -->
<!-- 
There are many ways to provide a internet connection, but many of them are not that simple and free. Aside from that, **security is a very important thing be aware when hosting any application on the internet**.

Using localtunnel is quite simple and free, but it's unstable and it exposes a port of your personal computer to the world.

Despite that, for many cases localtunnel should be worth to use. Here is a
